##Example 3 -- Card Draw Mechanics

This is an example configuration file to compare a deck with no card draws against a deck with some card draws.

###Setup

The [base deck](http://www.hearthhead.com/deckbuilder#cMH7MzR7Mzt7Mcr7McD7Mab7MaP7MaZ7Mbm7MfB7Muu7MGM7MAb7MAd7Mnv8V) is an all minions deck consisting of free and common cards.  We assume that the hero is a no-hero, that is, a hero that does not have any hero abilities.  

Against this base deck played by player1, player0 will play a deck with one substitution: a Gnomish Inventor for a Oasis Snapjaw.  The substitution is mana neutral, so it is literally a replacement of one card draw for 3 toughness points (times 2 for 2 cards).  The deck can be seen [here](http://www.hearthhead.com/deckbuilder#cMH7MzR7Mzt7Mcr7McD7MVd7Mab7MaP7MaZ7Mbm7MfB7Muu7MGM7MAb7Mnv8V).
