#Introduction
A deck file is a file (let's give it a .hsdeck extension) that holds information about which cards are in a deck.  

#Format
The format is pretty simple: class, card0, card1, card2, ...

The first entry is the hero class name, followed by a series of card names.

Card names should all be the English (NA) names of the card, with all spaces and apostrophes removed, CamelCased starting with an upper case letter.  The hero class name should be CamelCased as well.

All white spaces are ignored.
